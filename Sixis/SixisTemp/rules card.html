<h1>How to Play</h1>

<p>Sixis is a game about <em>rolling smart</em> and <em>pressing your luck</em>. Play it with your friends and family, or with our friendly robots &mdash; or both.</p>

<p>It's very easy to learn:</p>

<ol>
<li>When it's your turn, follow the on-screen instructions.</li>
<li>Take cards to score points.</li>
<li>Flip cards to raise the stakes!</li>
</ol>

<p>This game works best if you set the iPad down on a tabletop and have everyone sit around it. If you lack a tabletop, you can pass it around between turns instead.</p>
